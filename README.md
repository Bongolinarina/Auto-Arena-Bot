If you would like a customized version of the bot DM me on discord.

This bot does NOT log into your discord account so you don't have to worry about the bot doing anything bad although it isn't programmed to do so. The bot works by taking a screenshot of your screen or first screen if you have more than 1 monitor, it then scans the bottom left of your screen to see if there is an arena currently going on, if there is an arena message, it will paste your clipboard, keep in mind that you have to have "join" saved to your clipboard for this to join the arena, you also have to have your first screen active (click on your screen main screen if you have to monitors) at all times for this to work. If you want to go onto a different tab/screen I would recommend disabling the bot.

This bot takes a while to load up, so if you are staring at a blank console, that's why.
Keep in mind that this bot will not respond instantly after a join arena message is sent as it checks for the message every 1s. Although it is supposed to check every 1s, due to Python being slow at times, this time can take longer and the bot might not catch the message in time.
